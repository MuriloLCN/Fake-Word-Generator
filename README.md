# Fake-Word-Generator

Hello there, this program is a simple script to generate fake words that feel like they could exist.
It is based on this post https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/lot486/frequency_of_letters_in_english_words_and_where/ and it's just a fun idea to explore.
This is not a good way of generating words (for example, sulfixes and prefixes are not accounted for), and the process is entirely random.

I will probably try to add something related to sequences and affixes too, but for now this is just a "for fun" thing.
